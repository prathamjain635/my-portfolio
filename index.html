        <h3>Project Automated Door using ICs</h3>
        <p>An automated gate system utilizing an Integrated Circuit (IC) employs advanced electronics to control the gate's operation. This project integrates a microcontroller, sensors, and motor drivers to autonomously open and close the gate in response to approaching vehicles or individuals. It offers convenience through remote control access, ensures safety with obstacle detection sensors, and potentially incorporates security features like RFID or biometric authentication for restricted access.

        <h3>Project Drum pad using Arduino</h3>
        <p>
            The "Drum Pad using Arduino" project involves creating a musical interface with Arduino and sensors, allowing users to trigger drum sounds by tapping on the pads. It typically utilizes piezoelectric sensors or force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) to detect hits, translating these signals via Arduino into sound output, enabling users to play different drum sounds based on the sensor inputs.
